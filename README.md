# The Useless Web

This project is for my asignment the useless web and in my eyes there is nothing more useless than a function 
built from scratch when it already exists in one form or another.

# Code Review
Code review by: Jonas MÃ¥rtensson

1. Overall great and fun project without any major coding errors.
2. index.html: 10 - code body easy to follow but why have you made it a class?
3. styles.css:1-67 - Instead of one big file for you styling you could brake it down into smaller files that would make it easier to read and find a specific styling.
4. script.js: the function switchMode() could be built easier.
5. You use different types of event listeners as described in the assignment.
6. The mobile version is not exactly the same as the desktop version because of event listeners but works well anyway.
